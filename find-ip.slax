/*
*
*    NAME: find-ip.slax
*    PURPOSE: Created for SouthCentral Team to combine the output of 
*             the "show ethernet-switching table" command, the "show
*             arp" command, and the "show vlans" command.

*    CREATED: 03/22/09
*    BY: Jay Wilson (Solutions Architect - Western Area)
*    LAST MOD: 03/23/09
*    BY: Jay Wilson
*    VERSION: 3.00
*
*    MODIFICATION HISTORY:
*        V1.00 = Initial release
*        V2.00 = Added template WRITE-IT
*                Added the "z" option used for tracing
*                  script flow.
*        V2.50 = Added vlan information to the output
*                Added age information to the output
*        V3.00 = Created the template mash-vid that
*                  is used to put the VID (vlan-id) on
*                  the output.
